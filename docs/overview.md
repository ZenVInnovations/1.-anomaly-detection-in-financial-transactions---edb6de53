# ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

## Title
**Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions**

## Objective
To develop an AI-based system that detects anomalies in financial transactions using machine learning. The goal is to enhance fraud detection, reduce errors, and improve financial data security.

## Motivation
With the increasing volume of online transactions, manual detection of fraud is inefficient. Machine learning models offer a scalable and reliable way to detect unusual patterns and suspicious behavior in data.

## Project Goals
- Apply Isolation Forest and Autoencoders to detect anomalies.
- Use real-world datasets from Kaggle.
- Visualize results using Streamlit and deploy the app online.
