## âœ… Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust anomaly detection system for financial transactions, capable of:
- Detecting fraud or data errors in transaction records.
- Using both classical (Isolation Forest) and deep learning (Autoencoder) models.
- Visualizing results in a user-friendly dashboard.
